# SCSuggestions
An old app meant to serve as a mobile suggestion box for the Student Council at my middle school. Utilized Parse (though to revitalize the app it would be better to use Google Firebase) as a shared database for all suggestions and calendar events. Students were able to post suggestions to the database through the app for the Student Council to review and implement. Last modified: 8/31/15
